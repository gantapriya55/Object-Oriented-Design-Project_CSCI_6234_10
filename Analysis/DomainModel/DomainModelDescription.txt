The Domain Model for the Smart Parking Management System illustrates the conceptual entities and structural rules of a real-world parking environment. At the structural level, a ParkingLot is composed of one or more Floors, which consist of multiple ParkingSlots. This hierarchy ensures a facility must have physical capacity to exist in the system.

The operational flow centers on the Vehicle and its lifecycle. A ParkingSlot maintains a 0..1 relationship with a Vehicle, modeling that a space is either vacant or occupied. Crucially, the Vehicle to Ticket association is defined as 1 to 0... This reflects that a vehicle can exist in the system’s database (e.g., a registered member) before its first parking event (0), while also allowing a frequent parker to have multiple past tickets.

Upon entry, a Vehicle receives a Ticket, which serves as the primary record for timing and financial data. The PricingPolicy is associated with the Ticket to calculate the totalFee based on the duration of stay. The model further defines a 1 to 0..* relationship between Ticket and Payment. This captures the "unpaid" state at entry while supporting multiple payment transactions (partial or split) at exit. All financial attributes use the double data type for decimal precision. By using these specific multiplicities, the model provides a robust foundation for tracking both real-time occupancy and long-term financial history.
